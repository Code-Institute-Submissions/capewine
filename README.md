# Cape Wine

Cape Wine is a travel site which encourages both local and international Cape Winelands visitors to discover new places.
This site makes use of the Google Maps API to allow wine lovers to filter by drinking or wine tasting, wine farm restaurants and places to stay for a few nights in the Cape Winelands.
The Cape Winelands is one of the most beautiful areas in South Africa, with the rugged mountains, and practically untouched countryside.
The aim of this site is to show users the options available to locals and tourists when visiting the Cape Winelands

# Strategy

My goal of this site is to create a simple, visually appealing website to help travel lovers discover the hidden gems of South Africa by utilising the Google Maps API and Google Maps Documentation.

# Scope

To provide potential customers with information on hotels, restaurants and bars to visit in South Africa, more specially focused on the Cape Winelands

# Structure

The main structure of this website involves three main sections, the ‘Landing page’, the ‘About Us’ section and the ‘Discovery’ section.

The navbar appears and is fixed when the user opens the landing page. The landing image is a beautiful picture, creating a smooth experience for each user. Users can click on the downward arrows, prompting the user to go to the next section, The scroll is smooth using the scroll-behavior: smooth command CSS.
On smaller screens, the navbar collapses using Bootstrap. When that icon is clicked, a dropdown menu with text is opened, allowing the user to easily navigate through the site.

The images contain the Bootstrap img-thumbnail class to ensure both responsiveness and the shadow that accompanies the bootstrap class.

To ensure easy usability, I created buttons for the user to press to filter which activity they would like to know more about.

When a user searches for an activity and city, then a table appears with a list of all activities in the area selected.

The map automatically zooms into the selected city. If a city is not selected and a filter is, then it will drop pins by default to the centre of the country.

# Skeleton

This website is structured over one page, using Google Maps API.
T
he page is split into three core sections.

These are the wireframes, which include both the desktop and mobile view for each section.

3.  [Discovery](wireframes/discover-capewine.JPG)
4.  [Contact Us](wireframes/contactus-capewine.JPG)

# Surface

The colour scheme for this project is minimalistic. I was hoping to create a good link between the landing page and the color scheme throughout the page to keep the page attractive.  

The colours used were:

I used a really handy tool created by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to generate the color scheme. 

The site makes use of two key fonts :

- Montserrat
- Monospace
