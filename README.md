# Cape Wine

Cape Wine is a travel site which encourages both local and international Cape Winelands visitors to discover new places.
This site makes use of the Google Maps API to allow wine lovers to filter by drinking or wine tasting, wine farm restaurants and places to stay for a few nights in the Cape Winelands.
The Cape Winelands is one of the most beautiful areas in South Africa, with the rugged mountains, and practically untouched countryside.
The aim of this site is to show users the options available to locals and tourists when visiting the Cape Winelands

# Strategy

My goal of this site is to create a simple, visually appealing website to help travel lovers discover the hidden gems of South Africa by utilising the Google Maps API and Google Maps Documentation.

# Scope

To provide potential customers with information on hotels, restaurants and bars to visit in South Africa, more specially focused on the Cape Winelands

# Structure

The main structure of this website involves three main sections, the ‘Landing page’, the ‘About Us’ section and the ‘Discovery’ section.

The navbar appears and is fixed when the user opens the landing page. The landing image is a beautiful picture, creating a smooth experience for each user. Users can click on the downward arrows, prompting the user to go to the next section, The scroll is smooth using the scroll-behavior: smooth command CSS.
On smaller screens, the navbar collapses using Bootstrap. When that icon is clicked, a dropdown menu with text is opened, allowing the user to easily navigate through the site.

The images contain the Bootstrap img-thumbnail class to ensure both responsiveness and the shadow that accompanies the bootstrap class.

To ensure easy usability, I created buttons for the user to press to filter which activity they would like to know more about.

When a user searches for an activity and city, then a table appears with a list of all activities in the area selected.

The map automatically zooms into the selected city. If a city is not selected and a filter is, then it will drop pins by default to the centre of the country.

# Skeleton

This website is structured over one page, using Google Maps API.
T
he page is split into three core sections.

These are the wireframes, which include both the desktop and mobile view for each section.

2.  [About Us](wireframes/aboutus-capewine.JPG)
3.  [Discovery](wireframes/discover-capewine.JPG)
4.  [Contact Us](wireframes/contactus-capewine.JPG)

# Surface

The colour scheme for this project is minimalistic. I was hoping to create a good link between the landing page and the color scheme throughout the page to keep the page attractive.  

The colours used were:

![color scheme](assets/images/cape-wine-color-scheme.JPG)

I used a really handy tool created by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to generate the color scheme. 

The site makes use of two key fonts :

- Montserrat
- Monospace

# Testing

Manual tests were conducted throughout the creation of this site.

## Validators
- HTML
    - W3C HTML Validator:
        -  Document checking on HTML. Four total errors showing
            - Stray DOCTYPE which was interesting that it was overlooked throughout the development process. 
            - 3 errors stating that “Attribute btn-block not allowed on element button at this point.” Corrected and committed in two separate commits. 
            - A second test was conducted in the same HTML validator to confirm no errors. 
- CSS
    - W3C CSS Validator:
        - The W3C Validator displayed no errors or warnings to show.
- JavaScript
    - JShint
        - There are 16 functions in this file.
        - Function with the largest signature takes 2 arguments, while the median is 0.
        - Largest function has 25 statements in it, while the median is 2.5.
        - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 7 while the median is 1.
        - One undefined variable
            - Google
        - One unused variable
            - initMap
- During the development process I consistently checked Chrome DevTools to test during section construction. 

During the process I encountered an ApiTargetBlockedMapError in the console. 
This was rectified by adding  ‘places&libraries’ to the end of the API KEY to include the Places API. 

- Testing for Responsiveness
    - Testing during section construction was done primarily with Chrome DevTools, making sure each element works correctly and optimally, including responsiveness across devices. 
    - I planned to make the site responsive across all devices in Chrome Dev Tools. I am aware of a few issues with smaller screens. 
    - For navbar, I tested the functionality of all links, including the site brand which takes the user back to the Landing Page.
    - I spent time testing the nav bar as initially the Bootstrap collapsible navbar worked but the toggler icon did not show on smaller devices. I overcame this by changing it to a dark navbar and removed the customisation. No other changes to the nav bar were needed. 

- User Testing
    - After sending the site to my peers, the main comment that the site is beautiful. It was intended for the site to look nice. 
    - The users who helped test the site did not know too much about the Cape Winelands so I had to suggest a city to search for. I suggested the user search for Cape Town, Stellenbosch and Hermanus. 
    - User test comments include:
        - “The site works well on my mobile phone, there are some small concerns around the map section working on my phone”
        - “The site is interesting and it was enjoyable to learn about the Cape Winelands”
        - “The site is easy to navigate, the burger menu on smaller screens make the site easy to navigate”
        - “I would find this site useful when visiting the South African Cape”
